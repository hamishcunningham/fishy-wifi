<h2>Welcome to WaterElf Overview</h2>
<h3>A helpful device for monitoring and controlling aquaponics systems.</h3>

<p>The waterelf has a number of sensors and controllers, some built-in and some connected by cables. Together with a microcontroller, it monitors the environment and controls the flooding and draining of three growbeds. Data is usually sent to a cloud server for storage but the system can operate without internet connectivity.</p>

<h4><a href="watertemp.html">Water Temperature</a></h4>
<p>The water temperature sensor is fully submersible and should be placed in the fish tank.</p>

<h4><a href="airtemp.html">Air Temperature & Humidity</a></h4>
<p>This sensor is <b>not</b> waterproof, it can be placed anywhere in the growing area but away from water splashes.</p>

<h4><a href="growlevel.html">Growbed level</a></h4>
<p>This sensor is designed to be mounted onto a tube set into the growbed and free of media. It needs to be mounted at least 20cm above the maximum water level to preserve it's lifespan. The sensor isn't waterproof and will eventually corrode and need replacing after a year or so.</p>

<h4><a href="pH.html">pH</a></h4>
<p>The pH probe should be placed in the fishtank, with the bottom of the sensor in water continuously, but with the cable and first 2cm of the probe out of the water. This probe will need replacing every 6-12 months, and calibrating monthly for accurate results.</p>

<h4>Power</h4>
<p>The waterelf needs 5V power from a USB adaptor via a standard 2.5mm barrel connector, centre positive.</p>

<h4>Light</h4>
<p> light sensor is integrated into the transparent lid of the waterelf and records light levels in lux.</p>

<h4>Growbed valves</h4>
<p>The waterelf can control 3 pnuematic actuators that in turn operate the growbed valves. Each actuator contains a pump and a valve that operate together to pressurise a pnuematic hose. This opens the growbed valve, a re-purposed toilet cistern valve. When the pump is turned off, the pressure in the hose is released and the valve closes.</p>

<h4>Power socket switching</h4>
<p>The waterelf has an integrated radio control that can switch mains sockets on or off. Up to 24 different sockets can be switched, to control things like fans, pumps, heaters etc.</p>

<h4>Web control</h4>
<p>The waterelf has it's own built in wifi access point and webserver. By connecting to this, you can configure the waterelf to use your internet connection with your wifi details. You can also use the web based controls to operate the valves and power socket switching and view the sensor data. You can also configure and calibrate the sensors here.</p>
